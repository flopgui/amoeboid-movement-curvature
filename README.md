# amoeboid-motion-curvature
Code and plots for my Master's thesis

## Organization

- ``code``: Contains the code used for the simulations and plots
    - ``amoeba``: Simulations. Adjust the parameters in ``src/main.rs`` and run with ``./run.sh``
    - ``plots``: Code for the plots in the document
- ``sequences``: Full outputs of selected simulations
